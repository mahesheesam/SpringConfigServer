**Description**:

**Objective**:
The goal of this task is to implement pagination support for the Accounts API to improve performance and usability when retrieving a large number of account records.

**Requirements**:
1. **Endpoint**: Create a new endpoint `/api/accounts` that returns paginated responses.
2. **Pagination Parameters**: Support pagination parameters `page` and `size` in the request query to specify the desired page number and page size.
3. **Response Format**: Ensure that the API response includes pagination metadata such as the total number of records (`totalElements`), the current page number (`number`), and the number of records per page (`size`).
4. **Error Handling**: Implement appropriate error handling for invalid pagination parameters or other error conditions.
5. **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests to verify the functionality of the pagination logic and ensure proper handling of edge cases.
6. **Documentation**: Update the API documentation to include information about the pagination parameters and the format of the paginated response.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The Accounts API `/api/accounts` returns paginated responses based on the provided pagination parameters.
- Pagination metadata such as `totalElements`, `number`, and `size` is included in the API response.
- Unit tests cover the pagination logic and error handling scenarios.
- The API documentation is updated to reflect the changes related to pagination support.

**Additional Information**:
- This task is part of the ongoing effort to enhance the performance and usability of the Accounts API.
- The implementation should follow the existing coding standards and design principles of the project.
- Please coordinate with the QA team for testing and validation of the implemented changes.
