Performance Degradation (Form3):

Service degradation in UK FPS Payments led to 4 outbound payments being held in "repair" status, totaling $37k USD.
Duplicate constraint was removed after resolving Form3 issues, and all payments were replayed successfully.
RTP Incoming Payment Rejection:

An incoming RTP payment was rejected due to an MDM GraphQL API timeout caused by the closure of over 2000 virtual accounts via External API.
Once the Form3 issue was resolved, all related requests were replayed, and rejected files were reprocessed successfully.
