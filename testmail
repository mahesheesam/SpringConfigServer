Preferences modified and saved via the CSP UI will retain their preferenceId values for EOD and intraday, while for PseudoNacha, the default value is null. The null preferenceId values you're observing are because PseudoNacha report format type preferences (ACHNOC, NOC_TXT) are stored within the EOD column list in our database. When backfilling preferenceId values with the default preferenceId, we inadvertently included PseudoNacha report format types in the EOD list.
